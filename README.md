# Office 365 Chrome Notifier
Office 365 &amp; Outlook.com notifier for chrome browsers

Unfortunately Microsoft hasn't built a chrome notifier and most of the chrome notifiers out there ask you to input access credentials to check your e-mail at a regular interal.

This Chrome extension relies on having an open tab (pinned or unpinned) with outlook.office.com opened and logged in. The first time you access outlook on the web with the chrome extension installed you'll be prompted to allow notifications. After that, whenever the tab is not focused you'll get a pretty desktop notification about new e-mail.

It shouldn't be too hard to make this work for calendar and other MS notificaitons, just find the appropriate elements and watch them for changes.

Last but not least, this is not packaged. You need to follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en&ref_topic=6274409) to install it in chrome.
